 * A transform pass that adds goog.reflect.objectProperty calls to the property
 * name string literals that are emitted as part of TypeScript's default
 * decorator output.
 *
 * goog.reflect.objectProperty is a special function that is recognized by
 * Closure Compiler. It is called like goog.reflect.objectProperty('prop', obj)
 * and it is compiled to a string literal that's the property named 'prop' on
 * the obj value.
 *
 * This way, runtime decorators can use the property names (e.g. to register
 * the property as a getter/setter pair) while still being compatible with
 * Closure Compiler's property renaming.
 *
 * Transforms:
 *
 *     tslib_1.__decorate([
 *       decorator,
 *       tslib_1.__metadata("design:type", Object)
 *     ], Foo.prototype, "prop", void 0);
